The following project is meant to help you encrypt/decrypt documents. On Windows, you can use this on Word, Excel, PowerPoint and text files. On Linux, only on text files.

#prepare
You should first compile the C files and paste your path to them on the commented lines in engine.sh/.ps1 (Linux/Windows). 
Then, make all the changes needed for engine to be able to run.

#use
Open your terminal and paste the path to your engine file.
The programme will ask you for the file path and the key you want to use to encrypt/decrypt the file. If problems appear, the programme will stop (not changing anything) and warn you.
